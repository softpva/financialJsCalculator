# About
> A financial calculator developed in html-css-js that contains the basic math operators and financial operators (PV, FV, PMT, I, N), it contains too a graph that plot the operation on course

# Features
> - The financial calculator project primarily contains the financial operators PV: Present Value, FV: Future Value: PMT: Payment Per Month Time (really any equal period of time), N: Number of Periods, and IR/n: Interest Rate Per Period of time .
> - This project has too the follow basics oprations: +, -, *, /, +/-, that can use at any time.
> - This project was built in html-css-js.
> - In the top-medium display is showed an infix expression that is formad by insertion of numbers, operators, memory and parenthisis.
> - At the top of the application, a graph is shown where the current operation is plotted.

> ## Using as a basic math calculator  
> ![basic math calculator](./readmeImages/pict_1.gif) 

> ## Set the result above as a PMT value  
> ![set PMT value](./readmeImages/pict_2.gif) 

> ## Input 10 months of payments or years or anything  
> ![input n months](./readmeImages/pict_3.gif) 

> ## Input an interest rate by period
> Note, if interest rate will be set greater than one, it'll be considered a percentage.  
> ![input interest rate](./readmeImages/pict_4.gif) 

> ## Get the Present Value (PV), for example, pressing PV
> ![get the present values](./readmeImages/pict_5.gif)  

> Double click in PV (or any other financial button) to set zero.  
> ## Than calculate the Future Value, pressing FV
> ![get the future value](./readmeImages/pict_6.gif) 

> ## You can also calculate the interest rate for a given situation
> ![get an interest rate](./readmeImages/pict_7.gif)  
> or for another situation  
> ![get an other interest rate](./readmeImages/pict_8.gif)  
> or for yet another one  
> ![get an other interest rate](./readmeImages/pict_9.gif)

> ## You can also calculate approximately the number of periods for a given situation
> ![get an interest rate](./readmeImages/pict_10.gif)   
> or for another situation
> ![get an other interest rate](./readmeImages/pict_11.gif)  
> or for yet another one  
> ![get an other interest rate](./readmeImages/pict_12.gif)  

> ## And, finally, observe if n is too large, the graph synthetically indicates the values of PMT and n
